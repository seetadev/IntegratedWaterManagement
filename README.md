The Issue: Remote water monitoring systems have not been used effectively in emerging countries. We got motivated to recycle and use old phones and tablets, used devices like computers on providing remote water monitoring facility to prevent havoc in case of hurricanes, excessive rainfall. Chennai floods in 2015 has made it all the more urgent to design, develop and deploy such systems cost effectively.

Vision: Our vision is to carry out research on new models that incorporate technology and which aims at revolutionizing the water management practices around the world . The technology solution is designed specifically to address the needs of the water, health and environment eco-system comprising of civic bodies, water management units, hospitals, environment and health ministry, laboratories, citizens, R&D organizations and improve the operational efficiencies.

Just in Time service Availability of city’s water records suffering from environmental issues across different stakeholder through secure blockchain network.

Record Management Quality documentation reduces the issues regarding implementation of water management policies.

Research Research laboratories can use the data for diagnosis of water borne diseases, suggesting personalized action to water treatment plants.

4.Web Application Cloud-based web application with a chat-based interface for quick water wastage attention. It can also be used for environment protection and steps to reduce the issues.

Transparency Insurance agencies can utilize the data to provide customized house insurance plans to the customer. Ground water levels are at an all time low.

Better Management Practices Journal of water usage records covering complete city history improve the policy implementation and help define stringent rules towards saving water.

Our Magic Solution: Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of water management bodies, cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

Our app will provide the requisites features to share weather conditions like humidity, temperature and conditions and remotely monitor the water management policies in a place using used and broken phones and tablets, alarm clocks, internet connection, sync service, integration with IP cameras, raise safety alarms. The cost of deployment and added technology is limited which could help the families living in a variety of geographical regions.

We also plan to utilize SocialCalc, one of our open source spreadsheet projects and customize it for developing water monitoring and sewage management application. Features include Tabulation that enables the user to enter and edit data in a tabular format; Organization that enables the user to organize the tabular matter in several forms, Facilitates sorting of numeric data, comments to increase ease of understanding of data, names to access data in different modalities, clipboard function; Collaboration and the ability to support sharing of data over the network and multi-user editing and Interoperability between SocialCalc and Excel (.xls format), csv format.

Quality Assurance and Water Recyclability : Our serverless solution equips with two general purpose object detection engines detect 20 object types in real-time and 80 object types & better accuracy a bit slower. Our software will turns any IP camera to an AI beast within the snap of a finger. IPFS & Ethereum is a seamless solution to keep data encrypted and place the immutable fingerprints into blockchain transactions. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in water in real time and more object types for better accuracy.

Technologies Used: JavaScript, CSS, Tornado Python Web Framework, Swift, Yolo Machine Learning Library, Ionic Framework, Ethereum blockchain

Note about Ethereum blockchain: Ethereum is a platform that is intended to allow people to easily write decentralized applications (Đapps) using blockchain technology. A decentralized application is an application which serves some specific purpose to its users, but which has the important property that the application itself does not depend on any specific party existing. Rather than serving as a front-end for selling or providing a specific party's services, a Đapp is a tool for people and organizations on different sides of an interaction used to come together without any centralized intermediary.

Collaborative Goals Our solution is useful only to the extent it is used by the learning and environment friendly community. Thus, we are working with educators and health specialists around the world to focus on these learning challenges:

To make our project freely and readily available to learners everywhere To explore and share best practices To provide a forum for discussion and support for technology for learning To provide mechanism for evaluation and dissemination of results.

Wish to share that we recently won Get In The Ring India event organized under the aegis of SAP Startup Studio and had a conversation with Mr. Dinesh Rao, VP Software at SAP Labs after the event. We discussed about Connected Data Eco-system and SAP's efforts in that direction. We also discussed about the SAP's Hana and Leonardo (iot) platform. We were also approached by the Director of SAP's Leonardo iot platform to collaborate with them in a variety of efforts. We look forward to integrating our Remote Water Monitoring, Sewage Management, Quality Assurance and Recyclability of Water solution with SAP Hana Cloud solution and SAP Leonardo Platform and distribute to the government via the current SAP channel.

Business Model after the hackathon - Our business model has two aspects:

One Time Revenue: Sale of Software as a Service platform Recurring Revenue: Subscription service for usage of Mobile Application

We plan to have 2 channels:

B2B (Business to Business) : This will aim to serve business like mature startups, co-working spaces, business training organizations, Government and startup service providers.

B2C (Business to Consumer): This arm of the sales team will focus on startups and sell the product as a value added service on their mobile phones and computers.

We also intend to partner with a network provide to bring our network usage cost down and Co-brand our product.

We want to start with startups, incubators, government institutions and business coaching institutes as it would help them monitor the operational efficiencies, accessibility and assessment and help us provide scale. After that we want to target tablet, desktop and smart phone manufacturers to have this product as a factory fitted feature on their products.

Once we achieve scale using these platforms we want to start retail sales for business solutions.

A key channel we wish to focus on strongly is that of Indian government partnership. With Indian government focusing more and more on cost effective delivery of loans for every startup, we believe by working closely with the Indian government, we will be able to get scale and achieve sustainability and impact.
